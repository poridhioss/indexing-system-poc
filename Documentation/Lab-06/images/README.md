# Lab-06 Images

This directory contains theoretical diagrams for Merkle Tree concepts.

## Image Sources

## Image Descriptions

### image-1.png
**Hashing Concept**: Illustrates how cryptographic hash functions work - small changes in input produce completely different hash outputs.

### image-4.png
**Merkle Tree Structure**: Overview diagram showing the complete structure of a Merkle tree with leaves, parent nodes, and root.

### image-5.png
**Prepare Data Blocks**: Step 1 of Merkle tree construction - preparing and organizing data blocks for hashing.

### image-6.png
**Hash Data Blocks**: Step 2 of construction - computing cryptographic hashes of each data block to create leaf nodes.

### image-7.png
**Build Tree Bottom-Up**: Step 3 of construction - pairing leaf hashes and building parent nodes iteratively until reaching the root.

### image-8.png
**Merkle Root Output**: Final step showing the completed Merkle tree with the root hash that represents the entire dataset.

## Usage in Documentation
